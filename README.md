# AssosNation

Our goal with this app is to bring people to associations. We are creating a "social-network" for associations where they can publish posts, create events, answer to messages and more.

This is our final school project. Feel free to give some feedback about the app built with Flutter.
We aim to primary deploy the app for Android, iOS but our final goal is to have it deploy to the web aswell.
